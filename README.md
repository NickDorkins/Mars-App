# Mars-App

## Sean Hawkins, Nick Dorkins, Nebiyu Kifle, Cody Carpenter

Summary of idea.

We want to create a site all about Mars because we are out of this world. On the home page, we want the homepage header to be generated from the random Mars photo API. In addition, we want to make the background photo populate from APOD (Astronomy pic of the day). Moreover, we would like to create a navigation to a separate page that will generate Mars weather data (per sol). Potential part of our app: photos separated by the rover that took them.

What problem or pain point does it solve? a. Keep it high level without going into too much detail. (3-4 sentences is enough)

Although this does not solve any crisisâ€™s, it is important that people have access to the latest Mars images and weather data. To the little boy that dreams of becoming an astronomer, to the older gentleman just figuring out the web, this app is for everyone. We believe that our site will inform and inspire the youth of the World.

Minimum Viable Product (MVP) definition.

When users navigate to our site, they will see a random Mars photo generated on the home banner and a random photo from NASA as the background image. When a user navigates to the Mars Weather page, they will be able to see the weather on Mars for the next 7 Sols.

What is the minimum required for you to present on your demo day?

Minimum required is to have the random photos generate in high quality, as well as have the weather data displayed in a presentable fashion (we may spend extra time afterwards refining the visual presentation of weather).

APIs: NASA APIs:

- Mars Rover Photos

- InSight

- APOD
